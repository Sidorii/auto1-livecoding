/*
*
*  We would like you to build a simple key-secret store.
Show us what you are made of!
Apply best practices.
Squeeze everything out of your IDE.
Let's keep it simple.
--- Storages
Write a method that takes two parameters: a key and a secret.
Store them and return the given key.
key (not longer than 20): f.e. mY-cUsTom-kEy
secret: f.e. "My secret no one should know!"

--- Retrieval
Write a method that takes one parameter, the key, and returns the stored secret.

key (case-insensitive): f.e.
"mY-cUsTom-kEy" or "my-custom-key"
*
* */


/*
*
* 2. Allow the key to be a number (int, long, double, float, BigInteger, BigDecimal)
No restrictions on key length
key: f.e. 255 , 3.14
*
*
*
* 3. Generate the key
Add functionality to generate a random key.
f.e. "T4iz2Q"
